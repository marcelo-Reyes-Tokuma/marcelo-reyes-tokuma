# Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Marcelo

I'm a full-stack developer basing in Auckland, New Zealand, focused on building web applications that prioritize utility and solve real human problems. I have enjoy creating complex systems from many moving parts.

##âœ¨About me âœ¨

I studieat at an intense 17-week bootcamp totalling over 900 hour of work at Dev Academy Aotearoa. I gained skills in full-stack web applications using technologies such as React, Node.js, Typescript, Express.js, and Knex.js. Creating maintainable  and scalable projects is how I trained myself to approach programming. Dev Academy was an intensive, hands-on experience that replicates a a real life work enviroment. It taught me many coding skills but also helped me develop human skills, such as pair-programming, agile methodologies, project managment, and much more. 

outside of programming I'm a Siva Afi dancer, I have a keen interest in empowering underpriviledged and minority groups.

##Skill Swap

On the final technical week of Dev Academy we applied all we learnt to make a project from scratch over the course of a week. I created the idea after struggling to navigate the website StackOverflow, I wanted to make a beginner-friendly code forum with questions, profiles, messaging and video calls. 

You can find the Repo for the repository here, this is a project done with three others on a private repository.
